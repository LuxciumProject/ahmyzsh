    ## And here's a shell snippet that removes duplicates from $PATH.
    ## It goes through the entries one by one,
    ## and copies those that haven't been seen yet.

    if [ -n "$PATH" ]; then
        old_PATH=$PATH:
        PATH=
        while [ -n "$old_PATH" ]; do
            x=${old_PATH%%:*} # the first remaining entry
            case $PATH: in
            *:"$x":*) ;;        # already there
            *) PATH=$PATH:$x ;; # not there yet
            esac
            old_PATH=${old_PATH#*:}
        done
        PATH=${PATH#:}
        unset old_PATH x
