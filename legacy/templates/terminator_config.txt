NAME
       ~/.config/terminator/config - the config file for Terminator terminal emulator.

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the Terminator config file. Terminator manages its configuration file via the ConfigObj library to combine flexibility with clear, human editable files. As of version 0.90, Terminator offers a full GUI preferences editor which automatically saves its config file so you don't need to write a config file by
       hand.

FILE LOCATION
       Normally the config file will be ~/.config/terminator/config, but it may be overridden with $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (in which case it will be $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terminator/config)

FILE FORMAT
       This is what a Terminator config file should look like:

         # This is a comment
         [global_config]
           focus = system

         [keybindings]
           full_screen = <Ctrl><Shift>F11

         [profiles]
           [[default]]
             font = Fixed 10
             background_color = "#000000" # A comment
             foreground_color = "#FFFFFF" # Note that hex colour values must be quoted
             scrollback_lines = '500' #More comment. Single quotes are valid too
             cursor_blink = True
             custom_command = "echo \"foo#bar\"" #Final comment - this will work as expected.

       Below are the individual sections that can exist in the config file:

global_config
       These are the options Terminator currently supports in the global_config section:

       dbus   Control whether or not Terminator will load its DBus server. When this server is loaded, running Terminator multiple times will cause the first Terminator process to open additional windows. If this configuration item is set to False, or the python dbus module is unavailable, running Terminator multiple times will run a separate  Termi‚Äê
              nator process for each invocation.  Default value: True

       focus  Control how focus is given to terminals. 'click' means the focus only moves to a terminal after you click in it. 'sloppy' means the focus will follow the mouse pointer. 'system' means the focus will match that used by a GNOME window manager.  Default value: click

       handle_size
              Controls the width of the separator between terminals. Anything outside the range 0-20 (inclusive) will be ignored and use your default theme value.  Default value: -1

       geometry_hinting
              If True the window will resize in step with font sizes, if False it will follow pixels Default value: False

       window_state
              When set to 'normal' the Terminator window opens normally. 'maximise' opens the window in a maximised state, 'fullscreen' in a fullscreen state and 'hidden' will make it not shown by default.  Default value: normal

       borderless (boolean)
              Controls whether the Terminator window will be started without window borders Default value: False

       tab_position
              Defines where tabs are placed.  Can be any of: top, left, right, bottom.  If this is set to "hidden", the tab bar will not be shown. Note that hiding the tab bar is very confusing and not recommended.  Default value: top

       broadcast_default
              Defines default broadcast behavior.  Can be any of: all, group, off.  Default value: group

       close_button_on_tab (boolean)
              If set to True, tabs will have a close button on them.  Default value: True

       hide_tabbar (boolean)
              If set to True, the tab bar will be hidden. This means there will be no visual indication of either how many tabs there are, or which one you are on. Be warned that this can be very confusing and hard to use.  NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED, USE tab_position INSTEAD Default value: False

       scroll_tabbar (boolean)
              If set to True, the tab bar will not fill the width of the window. The titlebars of the tabs will only take as much space as is necessary for the text they contain. Except, that is, if the tabs no longer fit the width of the window - in that case scroll buttons will appear to move through the tabs.  Default value: False

       try_posix_regexp (boolean)
              If  set  to True, URL matching regexps will try to use POSIX style first, and fall back on GNU style on failure.  If you are on Linux but URL matches don't work, try setting this to True.  If you are not on Linux, but you get VTE warnings on startup saying "Error compiling regular expression", set this to False to silence them (they are
              otherwise harmless).  Default value: False on Linux, True otherwise.

       use_custom_url_handler (boolean)
              If set to True, URL handling will be given over entirely to the program specified by 'custom_url_handler'.  Default value: False

       custom_url_handler (string)
              Path to a program which accepts a URI as an argument and does something relevant with it. This option is ignored unless 'use_custom_url_handler' is set to True.  Default value: unset

       disable_real_transparency (string)
              If this is set to True, Terminator will never try to use 'real' transparency if your windowing environment supports it. Instead it will use 'fake' transparency where a background image is shown, but other windows are not.  Default value: False

       title_transmit_fg_color
              Sets the colour of the text shown in the titlebar of the active terminal.  Default value: '#FFFFFF'

       title_transmit_bg_color
              Sets the colour of the background of the titlebar in the active terminal.  Default value: '#C80003'

       title_receive_fg_color
              Sets the colour of the text shown in the titlebar of any terminal that will receive input from the active terminal.  Default value: '#FFFFFF'

       title_receive_bg_color
              Sets the colour of the background of the titlebar of any terminal that will receive input from the active terminal.  Default value: '#0076C9'

       title_inactive_fg_color
              Sets the colour of the text shown in the titlebar of any terminal that will not receive input from the active terminal.  Default value: '#000000'

       title_inactive_bg_color
              Sets the colour of the background of the titlebar of any terminal that will not receive input from the active terminal.  Default value: '#C0BEBF'

       title_use_system_font (boolean)
              Whether or not to use the GNOME default proportional font for titlebars.  Default value: True

       title_font (string)
              An Pango font name. Examples are "Sans 12" or "Monospace Bold 14".  Default value: "Sans 9"

       inactive_color_offset
              Controls how much to reduce the colour values of fonts in terminals that do not have focus. It is a simple multiplication factor. A font colour that was RGB(200,200,200) with an inactive_color_offset of 0.5 would set inactive terminals to RGB(100,100,100).

       always_split_with_profile
              Controls whether splits/tabs will continue to use the profile of their peer terminal. If set to False, they will always use the default profile.  Default value: False

       putty_paste_style (boolean)
              If set to True, right-click will paste the Primary selection, middle-click will popup the context menu.  Default value: False

       smart_copy (boolean)
              If set to True, and there is no selection, the shortcut is allowed to pass through. This is useful for overloading Ctrl-C to copy a selection, or send the SIGINT to the current process if there is no selection. If False the shortcut does not pass through at all, and the SIGINT does not get sent.  Default value: True

       enabled_plugins
              A list of plugins which should be loaded by default. All other plugin classes will be ignored. The default value includes two plugins related to Launchpad, which are enabled by default to provide continuity with earlier releases where these were the only substantial plugins available, and all plugins were  loaded  by  default.   Default
              value: "LaunchpadBugURLHandler, LaunchpadCodeURLHandler"

              If true, ignore the configured colours and use values from the theme instead.  Default value: False

       bold_is_bright
              If true, show bold text with increased brightness. If false, then text boldness can be controlled by applications independently from the text brightness.  Default value: False

       background_color
              Default colour of terminal background, as a colour specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a colour name such as "red"). Note: You may need to set use_theme_colors=False to force this setting to take effect.  Default value: '#000000'

       background_darkness
              A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how much to darken the background image. 0.0 means no darkness, 1.0 means fully dark. If the terminal is set to transparent, this setting controls how transparent it is. 0.0 means fully transparent, 1.0 means fully opaque.  Default value: 0.5

       background_type
              Type of terminal background. May be "solid" for a solid colour or "transparent" for full transparency in compositing window managers.  Default value: solid

       backspace_binding
              Sets  what  code the backspace key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "ascii-del" is normally considered the correct setting for the Backspace key.  Default value:
              ascii-del

       delete_binding
              Sets what code the delete key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "escape-sequence" is normally considered the correct setting for the Delete key.   Default  value:
              escape-sequence

       color_scheme (boolean)
              If specified this sets foreground_color and background_color to pre-set values. Possible options are 'grey_on_black', 'black_on_yellow', 'black_on_white', 'white_on_black', 'green_on_black', 'orange_on_black', 'ambience', 'solarized_dark', 'solarized_light'.

       cursor_blink (boolean)
              Controls if the cursor blinks.  Default value: True

       cursor_color
              Default colour of cursor, as a colour specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a colour name such as "red").  Default value: Current value of foreground_color

       cursor_shape
              Default shape of cursor. Possibilities are "block", "ibeam", and "underline".  Default value: block

       term   This translates into the value that will be set for TERM in the environment of your terminals.  Default value: xterm-256color

       colorterm
              This translates into the value that will be set for COLORTERM in the environment of your terminals.  Default value: truecolor

       use_system_font
              Whether or not to use the GNOME default monospace font for terminals.  Default value: True

       font   An Pango font name. Examples are "Sans 12" or "Monospace Bold 14".  Default value: Mono 10

       foreground_color
              Default colour of text in the terminal, as a colour specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a colour name such as "red"). Note: You may need to set use_theme_colors=False to force this setting to take effect.  Default value: '#AAAAAA'

       scrollbar_position
              Where to put the terminal scrollbar. Possibilities are "left", "right", and "disabled".  Default value: right

       show_titlebar
              If true, a titlebar will be drawn for each terminal which shows the current title of that terminal.  Default value: True

       scroll_background (boolean)
              If true, scroll the background image with the foreground text; if false, keep the image in a fixed position and scroll the text above it.  Default value: True

       scroll_on_keystroke (boolean)
              If true, pressing a key jumps the scrollbar to the bottom.  Default value: True

       scroll_on_output (boolean)
              If true, whenever there's new output the terminal will scroll to the bottom.  Default value: False

       scrollback_lines
              Number of scrollback lines to keep around. You can scroll back in the terminal by this number of lines; lines that don't fit in the scrollback are discarded. Warning: with large values, rewrapping on resize might be slow.  Default value: 500

       scrollback_infinite
              If this is set to True, scrollback_lines will be ignored and VTE will keep the entire scrollback history.  Default value: False

       focus_on_close
              Sets which terminal should get the focus when another terminal is closed. Values can be "prev", "next" or "auto".  Using "auto", if the closed terminal is within a split window, the focus will be on the sibling terminal rather than another tab.  Default value: auto

       exit_action
              Possible values are "close" to close the terminal, and "restart" to restart the command.  Default value: close

       palette
              Terminals have a 16-colour palette that applications inside the terminal can use. This is that palette, in the form of a colon-separated list of colour names. Colour names should be in hex format e.g. "#FF00FF".

       word_chars
              When selecting text by word, sequences of these characters are also considered members of single words. The hyphen and alphanumerics do not need to be specified. Ranges can be given as "A-Z".  Default value: ',./?%&#:_'

       mouse_autohide (boolean)
              Controls whether the mouse cursor should be hidden while typing.  Default value: True

       use_custom_command (boolean)
              If True, the value of custom_command will be used instead of the default shell.  Default value: False

       custom_command
              Command to execute instead of the default shell, if use_custom_command is set to True.  Default value: Nothing

       http_proxy
              URL of an HTTP proxy to use, e.g. http://proxy.lan:3128/ Default value: Nothing

       encoding
              Character set to use for the terminal.  Default value: UTF-8

       copy_on_selection (boolean)
              If set to True, text selections will be automatically copied to the clipboard, in addition to being made the Primary selection.  Default value: False

       layouts

              This describes the layouts section of the config file. Like with the profiles, each layout should be defined as a sub-section with a name formatted like: [[name]].

              Each object in a layout is a named sub-sub-section with various properties:

              [layouts]
                [[default]]
                  [[window0]]
                    type = Window
                  [[child1]]
                    type = Terminal
                    parent = window0

              Window objects may not have a parent attribute. Every other object must specify a parent. This is how the structure of the window is determined.

plugins
       Terminator plugins can add their own configuration to the config file, and will appear as a sub-section. Please refer to the documentation of individual plugins for more information.
