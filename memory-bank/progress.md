# Progress Report

## Completed Steps

1. Initial Memory Bank Setup
   - Created projectbrief.md with core objectives
   - Established techContext.md with environment details
   - Documented system patterns in systemPatterns.md
   - Set up activeContext.md with investigation plan

2. Initial Analysis
   - Identified key environment variables
   - Mapped basic file dependencies
   - Created initialization flow diagram
   - Documented code organization structure

## Current Status

🟡 In Progress: Understanding file references and dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Read and analyze MAIN-FUNCTIONS.sh content
   - Map function definitions
   - Document dependencies

2. Examine core/compute-path/path.sh
   - Understand path computation logic
   - Document caching mechanism

3. Investigate core/compute-path/conda-initialize.sh
   - Analyze conda integration
   - Map environment setup

4. Review MAIN.sh bootstrap process
   - Document initialization sequence
   - Map SCIENTIA_ES_LUX_PRINCIPIUM function

## Known Issues/Questions

1. Need to understand path caching mechanism details
2. Role of SCIENTIA_ES_LUX_PRINCIPIUM unclear
3. Full extent of conda integration unknown
4. Timing mechanism implementation details needed

## Required Investigations

1. MAIN-FUNCTIONS.sh content and exports
2. Path computation implementation details
3. Conda initialization process
4. Bootstrap sequence specifics

## Remaining Work

- [ ] Complete file content analysis
- [ ] Document all function dependencies
- [ ] Map complete initialization sequence
- [ ] Create .clinerules documentation
- [ ] Verify all file references
