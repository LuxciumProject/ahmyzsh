# Project Brief

## Project Overview

Analysis of file references and function dependencies in the ahmyzsh shell configuration system, specifically focusing on `source-me-in-etc-zshenv.sh` as the entry point.

## Core Objectives

1. Document all file references in source-me-in-etc-zshenv.sh
2. Map function calls and their dependencies
3. Understand the initialization flow and bootstrapping process
4. Document findings in .clinerules for future reference

## Initial Scope

- Primary file: source-me-in-etc-zshenv.sh
- Referenced core files:
  - MAIN-FUNCTIONS.sh
  - core/compute-path/path.sh
  - core/compute-path/conda-initialize.sh
  - MAIN.sh (bootstrap)

## Success Criteria

- Complete documentation of all file references
- Understanding of the initialization sequence
- Clear mapping of function dependencies
- Updated .clinerules with project insights
