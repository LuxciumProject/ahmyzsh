# Layer 1 — Foundation Verification and Bootstrap

Layer 1 ensures a universal, language-agnostic baseline. The aim is a small, canonical set of files and an idempotent initializer so higher layers can build safely. This document tells an AI agent how to **verify** an existing repo and **add only what is missing**. It also defines how to create everything from scratch if no files exist.

## Operating Principles

Layer 1 is about reproducibility and restraint. Verify first, then add only what is absent. Do not modify existing files unless explicitly directed elsewhere. Keep operations idempotent and safe to rerun.

0. Scientia est lux principium✨.
1. We MUST NOW initialize here a project together and set the rules and policies.
2. We will write from the most authoritative file for each agent.
3. We will bootstrap together a project and we will be in pre development mode for the time being.
4. Then we will remain in early development mode for as far as we need to see for the time being.
5. Let's verify what we already have in the project.
6. You must add anything missing BUT ONLY IF it is not overwriting anything.
7. Let there be a `scripts/` directory in the hyper root of our project.
8. Our `scripts/` directory shall have oversight over the project its structure and lifecycle.
9. Our `scripts/` directory shall only contain shell scripts.
10. Let there be a simple _'READ ONLY'_ script that verifies if each thing is there or not.
11. It MUST be maintained valid throughout the partnership between our human user and your ai agent.
12. We must write how to write policies and our human user will come with the instructiomns and your ai agent enshrine them in the project using the forat the user will describe to you via your ai agent.

## Process Summary

This verification and bootstrap process follows 5 sequential stages:

### Stage A: Repository State Check
- **Purpose:** Determine if working with existing or new repository
- **Actions:** Detect `.git/` directory, inventory 8 foundation files
- **Decision:** Route to "augment existing" or "full bootstrap" mode
- **Artifacts Checked:** `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `VERSION`, `scripts/README.md`, `scripts/init.sh`

### Stage B: Core Files Verification/Creation
- **Purpose:** Ensure all 6 root-level foundation files exist
- **Actions:** Create only missing files, never overwrite existing
- **Files Managed:**
  - **B1:** `.editorconfig` — Editor consistency (UTF-8, LF, indentation)
  - **B2:** `.gitattributes` — Line ending normalization, binary handling
  - **B3:** `.gitignore` — Exclude generated/system files (preserve `.vscode/`)
  - **B4:** `LICENSE` — Legal baseline (MIT default)
  - **B5:** `README.md` — Project documentation entry point
  - **B6:** `VERSION` — Semantic version seed (0.0.1)

### Stage C: Scripts Directory Setup
- **Purpose:** Establish automation foundation
- **Actions:** Create `scripts/` directory and core initialization script
- **Files Managed:**
  - `scripts/README.md` — Script usage guidelines
  - `scripts/init.sh` — Idempotent initializer with validation, permissions, datetime logging

### Stage D: Git Initialization
- **Purpose:** Initialize version control if not present
- **Actions:** Create git repository, stage files, make first commit
- **Condition:** Only executes if `.git/` absent
- **Commit Message:** "Scientia est lux principium✨"

### Stage E: Verification and Exit
- **Purpose:** Confirm successful Layer 1 completion
- **Actions:** Validate all 8 artifacts present and functional
- **Tests:** File presence, script executability, idempotence verification

## A. Repository State Check

Brief: Determine if you are in a repo already and whether the foundation files are present. Decide between "augment existing" vs "bootstrap new".

### Procedure
- Detect git repo:
  - IF `.git/` exists → mark `repo_state=existing`.
  - ELSE → mark `repo_state=new`.
- Inventory foundation files at project root:
  - `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `VERSION`
  - `scripts/README.md`, `scripts/init.sh`
- Classify each as `present` or `missing`.
- Continue with "create missing only" for existing repos, or "full bootstrap" for new repos.

---

## B. Core Files: Verify or Create

Brief: Each file is canonical in purpose. You verify presence. You only create what is missing. You never overwrite.

### B1. `.editorconfig`
Context: Standardize line endings, charset, and indentation to prevent tool drift.
- IF missing → create with UTF-8, LF, final newline, trim trailing spaces, 2-space default; include reasonable language overrides.
- ELSE → do nothing.

### B2. `.gitattributes`
Context: Normalize line endings and mark binaries for safe diffs.
- IF missing → create with `* text=auto`, LF rules for Unix-style sources, CRLF for batch, binary patterns.
- ELSE → do nothing.

### B3. `.gitignore`
Context: Exclude OS junk, editor files, logs, env, builds, caches.
- IF missing → create with a broad, language-agnostic set; keep `!.vscode/` meaning it MUST NOT BE ignored, it must be inside the repo files.
- ELSE → do nothing.

### B4. `LICENSE`
Context: Legal baseline. MIT by default unless instructed otherwise.
- IF missing → create MIT license with correct copyright holder and year.
- ELSE → do nothing.

### B5. `README.md`
Context: Human entry point. Must outline purpose, features, quick start, docs, support.
- IF missing → create with sections: Overview, Features, Quick Start, Documentation links, Contributing, License, Support, Acknowledgments.
- ELSE → do nothing.

### B6. `VERSION`
Context: Single-line semantic version seed.
- IF missing → create with `0.0.1`.
- ELSE → do nothing.

## C. Scripts Directory and Idempotent Initializer

Brief: Scripts are language-agnostic and safe to run repeatedly.

### Procedure
- Ensure `scripts/` directory exists; create if missing.
- `scripts/README.md`:
  - IF missing → create explaining idempotence, usage, guidelines.
- `scripts/init.sh`:
  - IF missing → create with idempotent checks:
    - Validates foundation files.
    - Sets `chmod +x` on `scripts/*.sh`.
    - Initializes git only if `.git/` is absent.
    - Prints project info and status.
    - It must print date time of execution.
- Never overwrite existing `scripts/init.sh`.

---

## D. Git Initialization and First Commit

Brief: Initialize only if no repo exists.

### Procedure
- IF `.git/` is absent:
  - Run `git init`.
  - Stage all: `git add .`.
  - Commit: `git commit -m "Scientia est lux principium✨"`.
  - (Optional) Create remote: `gh repo create …` and push.
- ELSE → do nothing.

---

## E. Verification and Exit Criteria

Brief: Confirm a correct Layer 1 state.

### Procedure
- Confirm presence of all 8 foundation artifacts:
  - `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `VERSION`, `scripts/README.md`, `scripts/init.sh`
- Ensure `scripts/init.sh` is executable.
- Re-run `scripts/init.sh`; confirm idempotence (no changes on second run).
