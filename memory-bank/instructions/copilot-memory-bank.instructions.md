# Copilot Memory Bank Protocol

- Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and relevant instructions before any action.
- Plan tasks and track them; update `activeContext.md` at session start with focus and constraints.
- After actions, summarize outcomes and deltas in `progress.md`.
- Prefer relative links; record provenance when copying content.
- Treat instruction files as immutable policy sources; suggest changes via prompts, not silent edits.
- Keep all changes additive and idempotent. Never overwrite existing files unless explicitly instructed.
