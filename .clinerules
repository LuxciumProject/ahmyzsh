# AHMYZSH Project Guidelines

## Project Understanding

1. Initialization Flow
   - Level 0: Entry point (source-me-in-etc-zshenv.sh)
   - Level 1: Initial setup (environment, paths, core loading)
   - Level 2: Bootstrap process (MAIN.sh)
   - Level 3: Settings and configuration

2. Memory Bank Structure
   - Use memory bank for maintaining context between sessions
   - Update files when discovering new patterns
   - Document complex relationships and dependencies

## Session Management Rules

1. Start of Session:
   - Read all memory bank files
   - Check projectbrief.md for core objectives
   - Review activeContext.md for current status
   - Consult systemPatterns.md for architecture

2. During Session:
   - Document discoveries immediately
   - Update progress.md with completed steps
   - Note branches for future exploration

3. End of Session:
   - Update activeContext.md with latest status
   - Document any unfinished investigations
   - Update .clinerules with new learnings

## Investigation Patterns

1. File Analysis
   - Start with high-level structure
   - Document file references
   - Note function dependencies
   - Map initialization sequences

2. Function Mapping
   - Document primary purpose
   - Note dependencies
   - Track usage patterns
   - Document timing implications

3. Branch Management
   - Note "TO BE EXPLORED" branches
   - Document dependency chains
   - Track investigation depth

## Documentation Standards

1. Memory Bank Files
   - Keep files focused and organized
   - Use mermaid diagrams for visualization
   - Document relationships clearly
   - Note investigation status

2. Code Comments
   - Include purpose and dependencies
   - Note performance implications
   - Document timing requirements
   - Track related components

## Project Behaviors

1. Performance Focus
   - Track execution timing
   - Note caching mechanisms
   - Document optimization patterns
   - Monitor resource usage

2. Shell Integration
   - Note environment requirements
   - Document shell-specific features
   - Track initialization sequence
   - Map function interactions

## Current Discoveries

1. Core Functions
   - load_all_config_and_settings_files(): Configuration management
   - timer_() family: Performance monitoring
   - load_(), source_(), call_(): File operations

2. File Dependencies
   - MAIN.sh: Bootstrap and initialization
   - MAIN_SETTINGS.sh: Environment configuration
   - MAIN-FUNCTIONS.sh: Core functionality

3. System Patterns
   - Layered initializations
   - Performance optimization
   - Modular configuration
   - Dynamic loading

## Investigation Guidelines

1. Depth Control
   - Document but don't dive into branches
   - Note relationships for later
   - Maintain investigation focus
   - Track dependency chains

2. Progress Tracking
   - Update progress.md regularly
   - Note completed investigations
   - Document remaining work
   - Track branch status

## Session Continuity

1. Context Management
   - Use memory bank for state
   - Document current focus
   - Note next steps
   - Track branch points

2. Investigation Flow
   - Follow level hierarchy
   - Document as you go
   - Note new discoveries
   - Update documentation

Remember: Always "follow your custom instructions" at the start of a session to ensure proper context loading and continuity.
