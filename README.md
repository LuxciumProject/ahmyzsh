I am using the [luxcium](https://github.com/Luxcium/ahmyzsh/tree/luxcium) branch on my macOS and [pc-master-race](https://github.com/Luxcium/ahmyzsh/tree/pc-master-race) branch fo my WSL on windows and now my main computer is using fedora so I am using the [fedora-working-station](https://github.com/Luxcium/ahmyzsh/tree/fedora-working-station) as my main development branch...
